		<div class="headline-text">INTRO</div>
			
		<div class="white-summary-text">Hey there! I'm David, an information architect who thinks outside-the-prism in search of minimalism. I wholeheartedly believe I could be a tremendous asset to Stanley Black & Decker - specifically your innovation facility in Atlanta - for a variety of reasons, which I will detail below.</div>

		<div class="headline-text">MENTALITY</div>

		<div class="white-summary-text">I tend to think differently than other people; something that is critical when building innovative teams, products and services. This is most evident in my lifestyle. For example, I currently juice raw organic fruits and vegetables every day and recently began practicing intermittent fasting. I genuinely love pushing the boundaries, which allows me to experience life in a unique light.</div>

		<div class="headline-text">SKILL SET</div>

		<div class="white-summary-text">For the past five years I have focused my efforts on the mobile app industry. Although Stanley is primarily a tools and hardware company, increased software integration could be a great way for your company to stay ahead of the curb. Can you imagine an application that recorded a door frame's measurements without needing a tape measure? The future is here!</div>

		<div class="headline-text">COMMUNICATION</div>

		<div class="white-summary-text">While I consider my design and development skills to be top notch, it is my ability to communicate complex ideas that sets me apart from other technical candidates. Not only was I the editor-in-chief at Skimmin, but also the principal liason with our beta and power users. In other words, I don't just code; I create.</div>

		<div class="headline-text">SUPERPOWER</div>

		<div class="white-summary-text">Okay, so maybe this is not a superpower in the traditional sense. But truth be told, my prowess with Google search enables me to operate at a higher level than most other humans. Because I am a self-taught programmer, Google has been my bread and butter for the past five years. So although there may be times when I do not have the answer, I can find it in the blink of an eye.</div>

		<div class="headline-text">BRAINSTORMING</div>

		<div class="white-summary-text">This is one of my favorite creative exercises! I even built a <a href="http://davemuench.com/brain-hurricane">simple web app</a> for it the other day! The design speaks to the fact that most innovation comes from the combination of two (or more) pre-existing ideas, products or industries.</div>

		<div class="white-summary-text" style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, .35); margin-bottom: 4rem;">Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing back!</div>
