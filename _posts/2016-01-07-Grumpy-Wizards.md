<p>I've been designing my brother's personal site for the past couple days, and as a result, I've spent a ton of time on Google Fonts. For those of you who aren't Web designers, Google Fonts is the bee's knees. It's hundreds of fonts that can be implemented on your website in seconds using a simple script. But there's one thing I don't like about it. And it doesn't have anything to do with Google or the product itself. It relates to the stock sentence that is used to present fonts to users.

<p>If you're unfamilar with typography, typically a font will be displayed using a sentence that contains all the letters in the alphabet, such that people can get a good sense of what the font will look like. Here's the sentence Google Fonts uses: "Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil Queen and Jack." This is just me being particular, but don't you think the sentence would sound better if it were: "Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for Jack and the evil Queen?" In the latter, the sentence's progression seems more fluid.</p>
