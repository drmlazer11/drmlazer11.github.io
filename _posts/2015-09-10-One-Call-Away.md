<p>Life is fleeting, but a glimpse in time.
Every second so precious - every moment so rare.</p>

<p>As I sit here and contemplate, these memories we share,
I can't help but wonder, just where | where | where.</p>

<p>I pray and I pray, oh and I hope and I hope,
That these dreams and this promise, won't be lost to the cold.</p>

<p>Won't you do the same, won't you keep us afloat?
Won't you do the same, won't you step off the boat?</p>
