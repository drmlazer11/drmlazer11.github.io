<p>Tonight I came across a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVV2Zk88beY">tremendous TED Talk</a> by a woman named Megan Phelps-Roper. In the presentation, Megan describes her experience growing up within the Westboro Baptist Church and how she finally came to realize the false and hypocritical nature of the cult's teachings. It's only about 15 minutes long and I would highly recommend you watch it.</p>
