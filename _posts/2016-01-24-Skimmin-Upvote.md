<p>We began to shift our focus from product-based to platform-based in Skimmin's third iteration. Meaning: now the core goal of our design was getting people to contribute and vote on content - not just read it.</p>

<p><a href="http://davemuench.com/upvote">Here</a> is the upvoting animation I built. The colors represent the six categories of news we had; which were:</p>

<p class="color: #999">U.S. | blue</p>
<p class="color: #999">World | orange</p>
<p class="color: #999">Sports | red</p>
<p class="color: #999">Technology | turquoise</p>
<p class="color: #999">Business | green</p>
<p class="color: #999">Entertainment | purple.</p>

<p>At the bottom are a couple screenshots of what a story thread looked like in our app.</p>
