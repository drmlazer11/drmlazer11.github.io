<p>We began to shift our focus from product-based to platform-based in Skimmin's third iteration. Meaning: the core goal of our design was now in getting people to contribute and vote on content - not just read it.</p>

<p><a href="http://davemuench.com/upvote">Here</a> is the upvoting animation I built. The colors represent the six categories of news we had; which were: U.S. - blue | World - orange | Sports - red | Technology - turquoise | Business - green | Entertainment - purple.</p>

<p>At the bottom are a couple screenshots of what a story thread looked like in our app.
