<p>We began to shift our focus from product-based to platform-based in Skimmin's third iteration. Meaning: now the core goal of our design was getting people to contribute and vote on content - not just read it.</p>

<p><a href="http://davemuench.com/upvote">Here</a> is the upvoting animation I built. The colors represent the six categories of news we had; which were:</p>

<p style="color: rgba(52, 152, 219, .9);margin-bottom:0;">U.S.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(255, 140, 0, .9);margin-bottom:0;">World</p>
<p style="color: rgba(231, 76, 60, .9);margin-bottom:0;">Sports</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, .8);margin-bottom:0;">Business</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 154, 136, .8);margin-bottom:0;">Technology</p>
<p style="color: rgba(164, 121, 228, .9);">Entertainment</p>

<p>At the bottom are a couple screenshots of what a story thread looked like in our app.</p>
