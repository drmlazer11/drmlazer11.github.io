God is Love. You may have heard this phrase before. It's short and sweet. Yet in many respects, it's a difficult concept to grasp. Who <em>is</em> God? What <em>is</em> Love?

Listen to what Paul says in 1 Corinthians: "Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud. It does not dishonor others. It is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered. It keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres." This is a Biblical description of Love.

Let's try something. Let's replace the word 'Love' with 'God' in that passage. "God is patient. God is kind. God always hopes. God always perseveres." That last verb - perseveres - is incredibly powerful. It is a promise from God that no matter how badly you screw up, He will always forgive you. The instant you confess your sin and (genuinely) repent, you are cleansed. God does not keep a record of your wrong doings.

The word 'perseveres' also refers to God's kingdom. When looking at how prevalent evil has become in today's society, it's easy to lose hope. A few weeks ago, Islamic State terrorists raided multiple venues across Paris and massacred over a hundred people. It was the epitome of evil and senselessness. At surface level, it appears that evil may have regained its footing in this world. But we need to remember that God already won this battle through His Perfect Love at the cross. Jesus' Perfect Love will always persevere.

We've all been commissioned to bring about His kingdom on Earth. It's so easy in today's society to forget this palpable task that we've been given.
