<p>About a week ago I visited the Harvard Innovation Lab for the first time. I met a Harvard graduate student during the AFC championship game who studied neuroscience at Northeastern as an undergraduate, and she told me to stop by and check things out when I got a chance.</p>

<p>Overall, I wasn’t too impressed by the structure and content of the lab. Given its association with HBS, I figured I'd be walking into an exotic new world; a place where I immediately felt my environment shift gears and become full of differentness. Instead it felt like I was walking into the first floor of a college library.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of walking around, Alana and I sat down with her co-founder to discuss their business. ALEX, which stands for Anyone’s Learning EXperience, is trying to become the Expedia of college classrooms. For instance, if a JavaScript course is being taught at Northeastern, and its capacity is 25 students but only 20 signed up, third parties can purchase those classroom seats for a discounted price. Right now, ALEX is in an iLab competition to raise baseline funding from the university. If they win the grant and continue pursuing ALEX, I told Alana I’d be more than happy to advise her on design issues, as I’m a huge fan of EdTech.</p>

<p>But I’m actually writing this blog post for a completely different reason. Sergio, one of Alana’s co-founders, asked me what my favorite aspect of interfaces was. I needed to think for a few seconds and then asked him to give me more time in thinking about the question, as it’s quite deep.</p>

<p>"Animation. Animation is my favorite aspect of interfaces,” I wrote to Sergio the next day.</p>

<p>You see: Animation gives an interface character. It evokes emotions in users that would have been dormant otherwise. It's a remarkable asset in its ability to help computers look and feel less like 1’s and 0’s and more like the physical world around us. In short, animation opens an entirely new dimension for designers: time.</p>

<p>The reason it’s so rare to find great animation in software is because it’s inherently difficult and time-consuming work. To make something feel more worldly, you need to observe the world. And guess what? That takes time!</p>

<p>Now if you’re designing software interfaces, of course it makes sense to spend the majority of your time observing other software interfaces. But don’t discount the importance of going to art galleries, public zoos and coffee shops. Personally, I find I have some of my best ideas while on walks, so I make time each day to walk around. Whether to local businesses or just enjoying a visit to a nearby garden, it’s imperative to get out and away from the screen!</p>

Here is the the best design I’ve ever received.</a> Pasquale fundamentally changed my perception of interfaces in February of 2014.</p>
