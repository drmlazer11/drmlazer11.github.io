<p>I've been working for equity since the end of my accounting internship in 2011. In other words, my disposable income has been nonexistent for about five years. I can't even remember the last time I purchased a new shirt or a pair of pants. Distinguishing wants from needs has become second nature.</p>

<p>But this got me to thinking: What will I purchase when I get a normal, salaried job again? Here's the list I came up with.</p>

<p>1. Cold-pressed juicer</p>
<p>2. Electric keyboard</p>
<p>3. Acoustic guitar</p>
<p>4. A complete wardrobe makeover - primarily shoes, shirts and pants</p>
<p>5. A few gifts for family and friends</p>
<p>6. Donate</p>
<p>7. Donate</p>
<p>8. Donate</p>
<p>9. Donate</p>
<p>10. Donate</p>

<p>I didn't put 6 - 10 to be a hardo. I've simply come to the realization that possessions are meaningless. Life is about giving and helping others. Spreading love and hope is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylT16QB6Uig#t=0m28s">free99.</a></p>
