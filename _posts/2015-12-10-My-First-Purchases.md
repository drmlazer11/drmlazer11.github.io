<p>I've been working for equity since the end of my accounting internship in 2011. In other words, my disposable income has been nonexistent for about five years. I can't even remember the last time I purchased a new shirt or a pair of pants. Distinguishing wants from needs has become second nature.</p>

<p>But this got me to thinking: What will I buy when I get a normal, salaried job again? Here's the list I came up with.</p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>1. Cold-pressed juicer</li>
<li>2. Electric keyboard</li>
<li>3. Acoustic guitar</li>
<li>4. New shoes, shirts and pants</li>
<li>5. A few gifts for family and friends</li>
<li>6. Donate</li>
<li>7. Donate</li>
<li>8. Donate</li>
<li>9. Donate</li>
<li>10. Donate</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn't put 6 - 10 to be a hardo. I've simply come to the realization that possessions are meaningless. Life is about giving and helping others. Spreading love and hope is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylT16QB6Uig#t=0m28s">free99.</a></p>
