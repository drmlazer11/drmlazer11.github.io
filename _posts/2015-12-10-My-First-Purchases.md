<p>I've been working for equity since the end of my accounting internship in 2011. In other words, my disposable income has been nonexistent for more than five years. Distinguishing wants from needs is second nature at this point. Tough, draining, exhausting. Those adjectives describe what it feels like to be broke. I can't even remember the last time I purchased a new piece of clothing or a new accessory.</p>

<p>This got me to thinking: What will I purchase when I get a normal, salaried job again? Here's the list I came up with. For the first five items, order is indicative of importance.</p>

<p>1. Cold-pressed juicer</p>
<p>2. Electric keyboard</p>
<p>3. Acoustic guitar</p>
<p>4. A complete wardrobe makeover - primarily shoes, shirts and pants</p>
<p>5. A few gifts for family and friends</p>
<p>6. Donate</p>
<p>7. Donate</p>
<p>8. Donate</p>
<p>9. Donate</p>
<p>10. Donate</p>

<p>I didn't put 6 - 10 to be a hardo. I've simply come to the realization that possessions are meaningless. Life is about giving and helping others. Spreading love and hope is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylT16QB6Uig#t=0m28s">free99.</a></p>
