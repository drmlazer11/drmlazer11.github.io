<p>About a month ago my brother and I ran an experiment for a raw organic nut company called Crunch Club. After a long failure with Skimmin, we decided that from now on our business ventures would follow the scientific method: make a hypothesis and then test it as quickly and cheaply as possible.</p> 

<p>As many of you know from high school or college, conducting <em>an</em> experiment isn't difficult. But conducting a <em>good</em> experiment is. It was for this reason that we designed the experiment to be as simple as possible: a non-scrollable landing page with a simple yes/no brand message.</p>

<p>As it turned out, 35% of the 50 people who clicked on our Google Adwords advertisement clicked 'YES.' So we continued onwards, as we considered that worthy of optimism.</p>

<p>This was the <a href="http://davemuench.com/crunch-club">follow up landing page</a> that we advertised on Google Adwords. Unfortunately only 20% of people clicked 'JOIN,' and it was for this reason that we chose to can the venture.
