<p>Yesterday I designed a mockup for a company called SlapFive. SlapFive is looking to become a B2B, mobile-first customer success platform where knowledge is shared via short audio and video messages. This was their use case:</p>
<p style="color: #888">"Carol is a marketer at HireDelight, a talent management software company, and uses SlapFive. She has heard from her sales reps that when buyers shop for recruiting software, they often want to know how the software will help them increase the flow of qualified candidates for their open jobs, and how big an increase to expect. She wants to ask her current customers to share their success stories about how they increase candidate flow.  She has used SlapFive to pose that question to her customers and 7 of her customers have responded with short audio or video clips.  Bill is one of them, he is an HR executive at Bank of New York who has been using HireDelight's software for 2 years. After sharing his story, Bill is curious to see how his fellow customers responded to learn from their experiences. Please show a screen or two of the experience that Bill would have consuming those experiences contributed by his fellow customers."</p>
<p>Here is what I created for them:</p>
