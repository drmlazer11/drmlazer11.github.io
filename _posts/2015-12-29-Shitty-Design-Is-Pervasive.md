<p>The annual Miss Universe competition was held in Las Vegas last week, and much like every year, there were scores of young women with beautiful faces and gorgeous bodies from across the globe. But this year's show took a novel turn when the host, Steve Harvey, mistakenly announced that Miss Colombia was the new Miss Universe. In actuality, Miss Colombia was the "1st Runner Up" and Miss Philippines was the winner. After a minute or two of Miss Colombia smiling ear-to-ear and waving her thanks to the crowd, Harvey had to return to the stage to reveal his error. It was painfully awkward to watch.</p>

<p>Memes and videos of the blunder immediately went viral. Some comics captured the embarrassment on Harvey's face, while others caught the bewilderment in Miss Colombia's eyes. Harvey's accident was the butt of many jokes for about a week.</p> 

<p>Here's my favorite meme, which was released on Christmas day.</p>

This brings me to the point of my post: Shitty design is pervasive. A couple days ago I was on LinkedIn and came across a photo of the "score card" that Harvey was handed.

When I saw this photo, I instantly felt bad for Harvey. This is <em>abysmal</em> design. 

It's easy to chirp from the cheap seats. So I decided to create my own score card that I think would have prevented this mistake. Three iterations and about two and a half hours later, this is what I came up with.

To conclude I'll say this: Design is everywhere. It's how you built that stair case. It's how you structured that database. And it's how you painted that canoe. Designers: Let's start taking more pride in our work. From this example we know that it can save a lot of embarrassment. But there will also be times when it can save a lot of lives.
