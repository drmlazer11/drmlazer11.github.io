<p>This afternoon I designed my new business cards. I landed on a black and white theme for a few reasons.</p>

<h3>The design speaks to my multifaceted skill set.</h3>
<p>I've always been a jack-of-all-trades. Growing up, I was a utility player in each sport I competed in. In baseball, I played every infield position, including pitcher and catcher. In hockey, I was a defenseman until 8th grade when I switched to left wing. And in soccer, my coach would put me just about anywhere on the field (except goalie). More recently, I was a co-founder of a bootstrapped startup, meaning I needed to wear multiple hats. Designing, developing, writing and marketing were my primary roles.</p>

<h3>I've come to the realization that duality is a major theme in the world.</h3>
<p>Life and death. Good and evil. Day and night. Warm and cold. Left and right. Male and female. Leader and follower. And the list goes on.</p>

<h3>I'm a big fan of minimalism.</h3>
<p>Black and white represents simplicity and no-bullshit. Don't beat around the bush; tell it to me how it is! What's the point of a business card? It's to tell the person you're connecting with how to contact you. In my opinion, putting your office location, twitter handle or personal website is superfluous information.</p>

<h3>Oh yeah, and these cookies are delicious.</h3>
<p>Nuff said.</p>
