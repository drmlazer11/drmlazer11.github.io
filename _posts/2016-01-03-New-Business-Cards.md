<p>This afternoon I designed my new business cards. I landed on a black and white theme for a few reasons.</p>

<h3>The design speaks to my multi-faceted skill set.</h3>
<p>I've always been a jack-of-all-trades. Growing up, I was a utility player in each sport I competed in. In baseball, I played every position in the infield, including pitcher and catcher. In hockey, I was a defenseman until 8th grade when I switched to left wing. And in soccer my coach would put me just about anywhere on the field (except goalie). More recently, I was a founder at a bootstrapped startup who wore multiple hats. Designing, developing, writing and marketing were my four primary roles.</p>

<h3>I've come to realize that duality is a major theme in the world.</h3>
<p>Life, death. Good, evil. Day, night. Warm, cold. Left, right. Feminine, masculine. Leader, follower. And the list goes on.</p>

<h3>I'm a big fan of minimalism.</h3>
<p>Black and white represents simplicity and no-bullshit. Don't beat around the bush; just tell it to me how it is!</p>
