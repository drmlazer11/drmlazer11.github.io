<p>My pastor dropped a truth bomb last Sunday. It was pretty surreal, actually. I grew up listening to this man preach the gospel.</p>

<p>I suggest watching the sermon in full, as it was a phenomenal message. That being said, I realize it's 40 minutes long. So if you want to get to the part I'm talking about, fast forward to 21:05.</p>
