<p><a href="http://griswoldmuench.github.io">This is a website that I designed for my brother a few months ago.</a> I just forgot to upload it! Similar to my own site's design, its purpose is to let words and thoughts be at the forefront. The photo isn't him (he was busy with earnings season at the time and I needed a black shirt photo to fit the design, so it's a friend of mine, Erik Malyak). And the copy & blog posts are currently just filler from my own site. When he gets more free time he said he would begin writing!</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and his name is currently still Andrew... In due time he wants to change it to Griswold...</p>
