Life is fleeting, but a glimpse in time.

Every second so precious - every moment so rare.

As I sit here and contemplate, these memories we share,

I can't help but wonder, just where | where | where. 

I pray and I pray, oh and I hope and I hope,

That these dreams and this promise, won't be lost to the cold.

Won't you do the same, won't you keep us afloat?

Won't you do the same, won't you step off the boat?
