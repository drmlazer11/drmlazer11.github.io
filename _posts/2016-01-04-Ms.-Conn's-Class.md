<p>Today I paid a visit to my first grade teacher, Ms. Conn. Little did I know; Ms. Conn is now a third grade teacher. And coincidentally, she teaches in the same room that my third grade teacher, Mrs. Carter, used to be in.</p> 

<p>Shortly after my arrival it was time for art class. The kids were learning about positive and negative space with a focus on black and white. So I saw a bunch of artwork that looked like this:</p>

<p>I found this ironic because yesterday I designed business cards for myself that — you guessed it — were black & white and made use of positive & negative space!</p>

<p>Overall it was a really fun experience. Down the road I can see myself becoming an elementary school teacher. I've always been a little kid at heart, and I hope I never lose that mentality no matter how long I'm in the business world.</p>
