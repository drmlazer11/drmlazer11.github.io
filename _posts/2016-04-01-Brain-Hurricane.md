<p>Today I built a <a href="http://davemuench.com/brain-hurricane">business brainstorming app</a> called Brain Hurricane.</p>
<p>The design speaks to the fact that most innovation comes from the combination of two (or more) pre-existing ideas, products or industries.</p>
<p>I'm currently conducting business experiments with my brother, so I created this out of self-need. That being said, if Brain Hurricane receives positive feedback, I'll add more functionality. For instance: categories other than business.</p>
