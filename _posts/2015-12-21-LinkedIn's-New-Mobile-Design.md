<p>Yesterday I designed a mockup for a company called SlapFive. SlapFive is looking to become a B2B, mobile-first customer success platform where knowledge is shared via short audio and video messages. This was their use case:</p>
<p style="color: #888">"Carol is a marketer at HireDelight, a talent management software company, and uses SlapFive. She has heard from her sales reps that when buyers shop for recruiting software, they often want to know how the software will help them increase the flow of qualified candidates for their open jobs, and how big an increase to expect. She wants to ask her current customers to share their success stories about how they increase candidate flow.  She has used SlapFive to pose that question to her customers and 7 of her customers have responded with short audio or video clips.  Bill is one of them, he is an HR executive at Bank of New York who has been using HireDelight's software for 2 years. After sharing his story, Bill is curious to see how his fellow customers responded to learn from their experiences. Please show a screen or two of the experience that Bill would have consuming those experiences contributed by his fellow customers."</p>
<p>Here is what I created for them:</p>

<p>Before sending them my work, I decided to email my brother, Andrew, to see if he had any tweaks. We frequently share screenshots of good design; so when he saw my screenshot, he thought it was LinkedIn's new mobile design. He replied back: "?," wondering if I was trying to point out something in their design specifically. Then about 30 minutes later: "Wait, you designed this!?"</p>
<p>Here's our text conversation from later that night:</p>
