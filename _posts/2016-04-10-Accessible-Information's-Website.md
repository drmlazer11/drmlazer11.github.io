<p>This past week I designed <a href="http://davemuench.com/accessible-information">Accessible Information's website.</a> I can't wait to begin hacking on some fun side projects, including our first app which will predict how many Likes your Instagram photo or video will get.</p> 
<p>My partner and I were in the same chemistry class in high school, so that's where the inspiration for the logo came from. We're both super stoked about AI and its potential!</p>
