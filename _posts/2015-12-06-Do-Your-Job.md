<p>Love them or hate them, the New England Patriots have an amazing catchphrase: "Do Your Job." From starting quarterback to third string cornerback, each player has a specific role, and it's their duty to fulfill that role - whatever it may be. To me, this is how society ought to work.</p>

<p>Growing up, my father worked in the McDonald's Corporation as a regional manager in the Northeast. When my brother, sister and I were of age, he had us serve as crew workers in a local store. Flipping burgers, taking orders, serving happy meals | the whole nine yards. He wanted us to gain an appreciation for the dollar. Sure, we could have gained a similar appreciation at other jobs. But at McDonald's you're almost guaranteed to be exposed to a few co-workers who are living at or below the poverty line.</p>

<p>All of this brings me to tonight. After a long day of reviewing error-ridden code, I decided to stop by the local Subway to grab a quick bite to eat. They call themselves "sandwich artists." Sandwich artist my ass. This guy was more like a sandwich assassin! Just butchering the process. Visibly bothered that I had interrupted his texting conversation, he proceeded to add heaps of lettuce (after clear instruction that I did not want any lettuce) and spill buffalo sauce all over the wrapping paper.</p>

<p>Look dude, I get it. Working at Subway isn't exactly the glamorous lifestyle you envisioned for yourself. This isn't where you thought you would be at age 28. But please... Do. Your. Job. This is the job that society has given you. Treat it with respect. There are billions of people in the world who would kill to have your blessings.</p>
