<p>About a week ago I visited the Harvard Innovation Lab for the first time. I met a graduate student during the AFC championship game who studied neuroscience at Northeastern as an undergraduate, and who is now taking classes at Harvard in its school of education. We connected after the game and she told me to stop by the iLab - as they call it - when I got the chance.</p>

<p>I'll be honest: Overall I wasn't impressed by the structure and layout of the lab. Given its association with HBS, I figured I'd be walking into an exotic new world; a place where I immediately felt my environment shift gears and become full of differentness. Instead it felt like I was walking into the first floor of a college library that had been remodeled to focus on entrepreneurship. It was too status quo in my opinion.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of walking around, Alana and I sat down with her co-founder to discuss their business. ALEX, which stands for Anyone's Learning EXperience, is trying to become the Expedia of college classrooms. For instance, if a JavaScript course is being taught at Northeastern, and its capacity is 25 students but only 20 signed up, third parties can purchase those classroom seats for a discounted price. Right now, ALEX is in an iLab competition to raise baseline funding from the university. If they win the grant and continue pursuing their venture, I told Alana I'd be more than happy to advise her on design issues, as I'm a huge fan of EdTech.</p>

<p>But discussing ALEX isn't the purpose of this post. I'm actually writing because of a question that came up during our conversation. Sergio, one of Alana's co-founders, asked me what my favorite aspect of interfaces was. I thought about it for a few seconds and then asked him to give me more time in thinking, as it's quite deep.</p>

<p>"Animation! Animation is my favorite aspect of interfaces," I emailed Sergio the next day.</p>

<p>You see: Animation gives an interface character. It evokes emotions in users that would have been dormant otherwise. It's a remarkable asset in its ability to help computers look and feel less like 1's and 0's and more like the physical world around us. In short, animation opens up an entirely new dimension of space for designers: time.</p>

<p>And yet, animation is very often overlooked. The reason being: it's inherently difficult and time-consuming work. To make something feel more worldly, you need to observe the world. And guess what? That takes <em>time</em>.</p>

<p>If you're designing software interfaces, well of course it makes sense to spend the majority of your time observing other software interfaces. But I will also say this: Don't discount the importance of visiting art galleries, public zoos and coffee shops. Personally, I find I have some of my best ideas while on walks. So I make it a point to walk around for at least an hour each day. Whether that be to local businesses or a nearby garden, it's imperative to get out and away from the screen!</p>
