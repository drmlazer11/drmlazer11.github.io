<p>My life is full of blessings at the moment, but I know a few people who recently learned they have cancer. As I was reading John this morning, one verse resonated with my heart:</p>

<p style="color: #888; padding-left: 1rem; border-left: .2rem solid #dfdfdf;">"I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."</p>

<p>What an incredibly powerful last sentence!</p>
