<p>My life is full of blessings at the moment, but I know a few people who recently learned they have cancer. As I was reading John this morning, one verse resonated with my heart:</p>

<p>"I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world." - John 16:33</p>

<p>That last sentence is <em>so</em> powerful!</p>
