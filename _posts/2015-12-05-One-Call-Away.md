<p>Life is fleeting, but a glimpse in time.</p>

<p>Every second so precious - every moment so rare.</p>

<p>As I sit here and contemplate, these memories we share,</p>

<p>I can't help but wonder, just where | where | where.</p>

<p>I pray and I pray, oh and I hope and I hope,</p>

<p>That these dreams and this promise, don't get lost in the cold.</p>

<p>Won't you do the same, won't you keep us afloat?</p>

<p>Won't you do the same, won't you step off the boat?</p>
