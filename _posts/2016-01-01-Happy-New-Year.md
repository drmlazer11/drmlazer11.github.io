<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>Thank you for the New Year.</p>

<p>Thank you for the people in my life that have showed me love and that I can show them love this year and those that follow.</p>

<p>Thank you for the food on my table that provides the nutrients for my body.</p>

<p>Thank you for my education and skills that allow me to build my knowledge of the world.</p>

<p>Thank you for my good health, which enables me to fully experience all this Earth has to offer.</p>

<p>Thank you for the courage I have to hold strong and stand up amid personal challenge and be the support for others' adversity - no matter the weight.</p>

<p>I pray 2016 is a good year.</p>

<p>Jesus, amen.</p>
