<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>Thank you for the New Year.</p>

<p>Thank you for the people in my life that have showed me love and that I can show them love this year and those that follow.</p>

<p>Thank you for the food on my table that provides the nutrients for my body.</p>

<p>Thank you for my education and my job that allows me to build my knowledge of the world and people and to learn everyday so that I can create new good things.</p>

<p>Thank you for the courage I have to hold strong and stand up amid personal challenge and be the support for others' adversity, no matter the weight.</p>

<p>Thank you for my best friends who look through my lens and analyze my condition and my outlook for the only mission that matters.</p>

<p>I pray 2016 is a good year.</p>

<p>Jesus, amen.</p>
